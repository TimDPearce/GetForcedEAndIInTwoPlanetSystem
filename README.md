Program to calculate the forced eccentricity and forced longitude of pericentre on a test particle in a two-planet system. Method based on Chapter 7 of Murray & Dermott (1999). The default parameters below are for Jupiter and Saturn in the Solar System, and reproduce Fig. 7.5 in Murray & Dermott (1999).

To use the program, first download and unpack the ZIP file (press the green 'Code' button on GitHub, then 'Download ZIP', then unzip the file on your computer). Then navigate to that directory in a terminal, and type e.g.

python getForcedEAndIInTwoPlanetSystem.py

Feel free to use this code, and if the results go into a publication, then please cite Pearce et al. (2025) and Murray & Dermott (1999). Also, let me know if you find any bugs or have any requests!
